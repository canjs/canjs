The next item we're going to go over is can.Model. Models make interacting
with JSON REST services *really easy*. They do this by encapsulating most of
the code required to connect to a service, and managing the data the service
returns. Additionally, can.Model extends can.Map, meaning that the objects
returned have all of the features of a can.Map, such as being observable.

We'll use a can.Model to provide data for our restaurant list.

In the models folder, create a file called "site_models.js". Add the
following code:

```
/**
 * Restaurants Model
 */
var RestaurantModel = can.Model.extend({
	findAll: "GET /restaurants"
},
//Include second, blank parameter object to set instanceProperties
{});
```

Because it is a can.Construct, can.Model.extend can take up to three parameters:

1. name
2. staticProperties
3. instanceProperties

A can.Model's staticProperties parameter has several reserved properties you
can add that simplify accessing data from a JSON REST service. These
properties are:

1. findAll
2. findOne
3. create
4. update
5. destroy

The findXxx methods are available directly off of the object definition (i.e.,
they are static). The create, update, and destroy methods are available off of
specific instances of a can.Model. We'll see how to use these below.

**Reminder: The number of parameters you pass in to an extend method is
**important. If you pass in a single parameter object, the extend method will
**use that to set the instanceProperties. If you pass in two parameter
**objects, the *first* object passed in will be used to set the
***staticProperties*. The second parameter will be used to set the
***instanceProperties*. Here, we only want to set the staticProperties, so we
**must pass in a second, blank object.

A few examples illustrate this, below:

```
var MyModel = can.Model.extend({
 findAll: function () {
 // Static method
 }
}, {
 destroy: function () {
 // Instance method
 }
});

MyModel.findAll(); // Reference a method defined on the contructor

var modelInstance = new MyModel();
modelInstance.destroy(); // Reference a method defined on the prototype
```

##The Data for Our Model

We're not going to connect to a server to retrieve our data; however, we're
going to code our model as if we were. How can this possibly work? CanJS
provides a handy utility, can.fixture, that we can use to mimic the
functionality of connecting to a server. As the CanJS docs say, "can.fixture
intercepts an AJAX request and simulates the response with a file or a
function. You can use [can.fixutre] to develop JavaScript independently of
backend services."

can.fixture is not included with the base CanJS package. It's a good practice
to keep it separate from your production CanJS library, which is why we
downloaded it from its CDN in a separate script tag, rather than including it
with our custom download. *If you use can.fixture during development, remember
to remove it once you are connecting to your REST services*.

Let's create a fixture that will respond to our requests for menu item data.
Create another file in the models folder called "fixtures.js". Add the
following code to that file:

```
/**
 * Restaurants Model Fixture
 */
can.fixture("GET /restaurants", function requestHandler() {
	return [
		{
			"name": "Spago",
			"location": "USA",
			"cuisine": "Modern",
			"owner": "Wolfgang Puck",
			"restaurantId": 1
		},
		{
			"name": "El Bulli",
			"location": "Spain",
			"cuisine": "Modern",
			"owner": "Ferran Adria",
			"restaurantId": 2
		},
		{
			"name": "The French Laundry",
			"location": "USA",
			"cuisine": "French Traditional",
			"owner": "Thomas Keller",
			"restaurantId": 3
		}
	];
});
```

The first argument to can.fixture, "GET /restaurants", tells CanJS to
intercept any GET requests to the resource "/restaurants". The second argument
is a function that returns the data we want to get when the application makes
a service call. Because we're simulating a findAll method, we need to return
an array. The findAll method expects an array. By default, if it does not
receive one, it will throw an error. If you need to connect to services that
return data that doesn't match the expected return type of the findXxx
methods, don't fret. There are ways to manage this, which we'll work with
later on.

##Connecting the Model to the Component

It's time to connect all of this together in our view model. Open up
restaurant_list_component.js, and edit the RestaurantListViewModel as follows,
updating the restaurants property to receive data from the model we created:

```
var RestaurantListViewModel = can.Map.extend({
	restaurants: new RestaurantModel.List({}),
	currentRestaurant: undefined,
	restaurantSelected: function (viewModel, select) {
		var restaurant = select.find('option:checked').data('restaurant');
		var currentRestaurant = 'currentRestaurant';
		this.attr(currentRestaurant, restaurant);
	}
});
```

Note that there are a few ways to call a findAll method on a can.Model. The
first way is to call the method explicitly. Using the RestaurantModel as an
example, that would look like this:

```
RestaurantModel.findAll({//paramsObject},
	function success(returnedObject){
		//
	},
	function error(errorObject){
		//
	});
```

In the code above, however, we called the findAll method indirectly:

```
restaurants: new RestaurantModel.List({}),
```

This is a special feature of the can.Model.List constructor. When can.Model is
extended, can.Model.List is automatically extended, as well. It is set as the
model's List property. If a can.Model.List is instantiated, and you pass in a
plain JavaScript object for its construction parameter, that parameter is used
as the parameter for the Model's findAll method. At first, this will return an
empty list; however, the can.Model's findAll method will then be called, and
the list will be populated with the results of that call automatically, once
the findAll method receives its results.

We'll look at the can.Model's findOne method later on, when we create our Menu
Component. Finally, let's add the scripts we created to our index.html file:

```
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="libs/can.custom.js"></script>
<script src="//canjs.com/release/2.1.4/can.fixture.js"></script>
<!--Begin add-->
<script src="models/fixtures.js"></script>
<script src="models/site_models.js"></script>
<!--End add-->
<script src="components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list_component.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

Let's go back to our app now, and see what happens! If everything went
according to plan, you should see something like this:

And, when you select a restaurant from the list, you should see:
