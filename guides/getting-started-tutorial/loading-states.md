Loading data from a remote server never happens immediately, so it’s a best
practice to show some sort of indicator to improve the user’s experience.
CanJS makes this easy with observable promises.

Now that we have the cities and states loading from our fixtures, let’s get
a list of restaurants when a city is selected. Let’s start by modifying
the `components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.js` file. Find this line:

```
		// Restaurant code will go here
```

and replace it with these lines:

```
		restaurants: {
			get: function(){
				var city = this.attr('city'),
					state = this.attr('state');

				return state && city ?
					Restaurant.findAll({
						'address.state': state,
						'address.city': city
					}) : null;
			}
		}
```

Here, we’re adding a new `restaurants` property that is a promise returned
by `can.Model.findAll()` (if a city and state are selected). This promise
has a few properties:

- `isPending`: indicates that the promise hasn’t been resolved or rejected
- `isResolved`: indicates that the promise has been resolved
- `value`: the value of the resolved promise

Now let’s make use of this new property and it’s attributes in our
`components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.stache` template. Find this line:

```
  <!-- Restaurants code will go here -->
```

and replace it with these lines:

```
  {{#if restaurants.isPending}}
  <div class="restaurant loading"></div>
  {{/if}}

  {{#if restaurants.isResolved}}
    {{#each restaurants.value}}
    <div class="restaurant">
      <img src="{{images.thumbnail}}" width="100" height="100">
      <h3>{{name}}</h3>
      {{#address}}
      <div class="address">
        {{street}}<br />{{city}}, {{state}} {{zip}}
      </div>
      {{/address}}

      <div class="hours-price">
        $$$<br />
        Hours: M-F 10am-11pm
        <span class="open-now">Open Now</span>
      </div>

      <a class="btn" can-href="{ page='restaurants' slug=slug }">Place My Order</a>
      <br />
    </div>
    {{/each}}
  {{/if}}
```

You’ll notice the `{{#if restaurants.isPending}}` and
`{{#if restaurants.isResolved}}` lines; the first is for showing a loading
indicator while the restaurants are being loaded, and the second is for
showing the list of restaurants once they’ve been fetched from the server
(or in our case, from the fixtures). After they have,
`{{#each restaurants.value}}` iterates over the list of restaurants to show
them on the page.

Speaking of fixtures, let’s modify our `models/fixtures.js` file. Add the
following lines:

```
can.fixture('GET /api/restaurants', 'models/restaurants.json');
can.fixture('GET /api/restaurants/{_id}', 'models/spago.json');
```

The first line will let us make a `GET` request to `/api/restaurants` to
fetch the list of restaurants. The second line will return data for
a specific restaurant. Normally, this would be dynamic, depending on which
restaurant we want info for. For simplicity, however, we’re
responding with the same fixture data regardless of which restaurant is
requested.

Go ahead and refresh the Restaurants page in your browser. Now, we can
select a state, a city, and then immediately see a list of restaurants!
