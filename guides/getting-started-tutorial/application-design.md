 - Designing an Application

The first step in putting together a CanJS app is sketching out the various
states of your application, as you understand them at the moment
(requirements are always subject to change!),
and any supporting elements you might need.

We’ll be building a small application called “Place My Order”. Place My Order is a
website that lets you select from available restaurants in your area, view their
menus, and purchase items for delivery. For this sample application, we’ll keep
things pretty simple. We won’t worry about registration, authentication, or
payment processing. We’re just going to create an application with six states:

1. Home
2. Select a Restaurant
3. View a Restaurant
4. Order Form
5. Confirmation
6. View Order History

And a few supporting objects:

1. Menus
2. Menu Items
3. Restaurant List
4. Cities
5. States
6. Orders
7. Order History List
