<div class="getting-started">

We've come a long way since we started developing our first CanJS application.
Nice work! Together, we've covered:

- The recommended application structure.
- Building can.Components.
- Binding to templates with can.view.
- Accessing service-exposed data with can.Model.
- Interrupting service calls to mimic server responses with can.fixture.
- Tying the application together with an Application State object.
- Binding the Application State object with the base template, and the
  application's route to enable routing.
- Using can.route to make custom routes.

Those are all the pieces you need to start building applications with CanJS
today.
