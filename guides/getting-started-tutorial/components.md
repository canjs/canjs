## First can.Component
If you recall from the introduction, a [`can.Component`](../docs/can.Component.html) is like a self-contained,
mini web application; in other words, it’s encapsulated. Because `can.Component`’s are
encapsulated, they should each contain their own:

- View template file (.stache file)
- JavaScript file
- CSS file

This is why we created a `components` folder for our app&mdash;instead of, say, a
`js` folder. Each component we develop will be in a folder that contains all
the files that support that component. This makes components portable,
enabling you to reuse them across projects. It also isolates them, making
them easier to test and maintain.

Put the following code inside `components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.js`:

```
can.Component.extend({
  tag: 'pmo-restaurant-list',
  template: can.view('components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.stache'),
  viewModel: {
    currentRestaurant: 'Hello Restaurant Customer'
  }
});
```

Add the following code to `components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.stache`:

```
<h1>{{currentRestaurant}}</h1>
```

Finally, we need to add a reference to `components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.js`
in the index.html file. Find this line:

```
<!-- Replace with restaurant list component script -->
```

and replace it with this line:

```
<script src="components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.js"></script>
```

Now, go back out to your app in the browser and refresh it. On the Restaurants page, you should
see it printing: "Hello Restaurant Customer".

### Auto Instantiation

If you recall from [our previous discussion regarding `can.Construct`](Constructors.html), whenever you
declare an object using `can.Construct`, it must be instantiated. Normally, you
would either directly instantiate objects using the `new` keyword, or pass the
constructor to an object that would create instances of it. *`can.Component` is
an exception.*

All we have to do is declare the `can.Component` using its `extend` function.
Once you declare your `can.Component`, you’ve registered your component with CanJS.
When CanJS parses the `main.stache` file and encounters the
`<pmo-restaurant-list>` tag, it will automatically instantiate the `can.Component`
associated with it, generate the component’s view inside of its custom tag,
and bind that view to your component’s scope.

### Basic Anatomy of a can.Component

The `can.Component` we created above had three properties.

- [tag](#tag),
- [template](#template), and
- [viewModel](#viewmodel)

```
can.Component.extend({
  tag: 'pmo-restaurant-list',
  template: can.view('components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.stache'),
  viewModel: {
    currentRestaurant: 'Hello Restaurant Customer'
  }
});
```

<a name="tag"></a>
#### The “tag” Property
The `can.Component`’s `tag` property associates that
`can.Component` with a specific, custom HTML tag.

As mentioned above, when the template containing the `can.Component`’s tag is
parsed, the `can.Component` is instantiated and the contents of its rendered
template are inserted as the HTML contents of the custom tag.

<a name="template"></a>
#### Template
The `template` property of the `can.Component` contains the string
value of the `can.Component`’s template. Note that the template property just
contains a string value. You can inline the template, if it is small. However,
the recommended way of working with templates, to maintain separation of
concerns, is to keep them in their own files and load them using `can.view`, as
we have done here.

<a name="viewmodel"></a>
#### View Model
The `viewModel` object is the `can.Component`’s view model. The view
model is an abstraction of the view that exposes public properties and
functions. Any property or function defined on the view model object is available
from the `can.Component`’s template as either a Stache data key, or a function.
In our example above, we created the property `currentRestaurant` and then
referenced it as a Stache data key in our template.
