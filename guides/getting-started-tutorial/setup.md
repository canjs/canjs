To begin, we’ll use an [example project](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/blob/guides-overhaul/guides/examples/PlaceMyOrder/ch-0_canjs-getting-started.zip?raw=true)
that has all of the dependencies required for the sample app that we’re going
to build. The example project also has some CSS and images to make our example
app a little bit more stylish.

## Folder Structure

The example project has the following folder structure:

<pre>
└── /
	├── app.js
	├── components
	├── css
	├── images
	├── index.html
	├── libs
	└── models
</pre>

The `app.js` folder is used to bootstrap our application. We’ll discuss this
in more detail <a href="#application-bootstrap">below</a>.

The `components` folder is where we’ll put all of the smaller parts that make
up our application. A component-based structure makes it easier to both manage
the contents of the component and port the component (should you want to use
it in another application).

The `css` folder contains a `style.css` file that is used for the entire app.
Because we’re using a component-based structure, we would typically recommend
putting any CSS files in their respective component folders, but we’ve only
included one CSS file here for simplicity.

The `images` folder contains images that are used throughout the app.
Again, if you had images that were specific to any components, we would
recommend putting them in their respective component folder.

The `index.html` file is the HTML file that loads all of the app’s scripts and
styles.

The `libs` folder contains all of the app’s JavaScript dependencies.

The `models` folder contains some JSON files that will work as fake server
responses and some JavaScript files that we’ll fill out later to mock an
HTTP server.

## Dependencies

### CanJS

The easiest way to get CanJS is to use <a href="../download.html" target="_blank">the custom download page</a>,
which allows you to download the specific parts of CanJS you need for your application.

The custom download page loads with all the elements in the core CanJS library
already selected. We wanted all of those in our build, so we left them checked.
CanJS relies on an external core library for some of its functionality. There
are several options available (jQuery, Dojo, YUI, etc.). The default option is
jQuery; that's what we’ll be working with here.

The right side of the page lists all of the plugins. From the list of plugins,
we selected the following:

![CanJS plugins to select](../can/guides/images/setup/DownloadOptions.png)

At the bottom of the page, clicking the download button will prompt you to
download a file called `can.custom.js`, which you can save to your local machine.

There is one additional file we needed. This file is special because normally
you wouldn't want it to be a part of your final application,
but it can be very helpful during development. The file is `can.fixture.js`.
[can.fixture](../docs/can.fixture.html) allows you to simulate RESTful services.
You can download it <a href="http://canjs.com/release/2.3.0/can.fixture.js" target="_blank">here</a>.

### jQuery

<a href="http://jquery.com/download/" target="_blank">jQuery 2.x</a> is also
required. We downloaded the most recent version of jQuery and put the `jquery.js`
file in the `libs` folder.

## index.html <a name="index-file"></a>

Our `index.html` file currently looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head lang="en">
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Place My Order</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- CanJS application root -->
    <div id="can-main"></div>
    <script src="libs/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="libs/can.custom.js"></script>
    <script src="libs/can.fixture.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

At the bottom of the page, just before the closing body tag, are all of the script
tags. We’re using the jQuery edition of CanJS, so the first script tag
loaded must be jQuery. Following jQuery, we load `can.custom.js`.

Earlier, we mentioned including `can.fixture.js`. In a
normal project, once you connected to the actual REST services, you would
remove `can.fixture.js`. In addition, to simplify things, we’re provided a CSS
file for you with all the styles needed for this example.

## Application Bootstrap <a name="application-bootstrap"></a>
The `app.js` file is the script that will bootstrap our application. Edit the
file as follows:

```
$(function () {
  $('#can-main').html('The Requisite “Hello World” Message');
});
```

If you open up your application in a browser, you should see:

> The Requisite “Hello World” Message

At this point, we haven't done much. We aren't using CanJS at all yet.
We’re just using jQuery to set the HTML contents of a DOM element.

So, how do we get the application to actually *do something*? Building apps
with CanJS centers around building `can.Component`'s. Read on to the next
chapter to learn more.
