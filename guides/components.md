## Constructors in CanJS

Before we work with any of the objects in CanJS, it will be helpful for us if we
understand [can.Construct](../docs/can.Construct.html). Most of the objects in CanJS are derived from
can.Construct. can.Construct provides a way to easily use the power of
prototypal inheritance without worrying about hooking up all the particulars
yourself.

Without going into exhaustive detail, can.Construct contains a few methods we'll encounter frequently in other objects:

- Prototype
	- init
- Static
	- extend

We'll look at the extend method first.

### The extend method
can.Construct's `extend` method is used to create
"constructor functions". Constructor functions create instances of objects.
The extend method can take up to three arguments:

1. name: string
2. staticProperties: object
3. instanceProperties: object

The extend method behaves differently depending on the number of arguments you
pass it. The name and staticProperties arguments are optional. For example, if
you pass it one argument, it will be use the value you pass it to set its
instanceProperties. If you pass it two arguments, it uses the first to set its
staticProperties, and the second to set its instanceProperties. Finally, if
you pass in all three arguments, the first will set its name, the second sets its
staticProperties, and the third becomes its instanceProperties.

In the example below, I only want to pass in staticProperties. Therefore, I
must call the method as follows:

```
can.Construct.extend({
	//Static properties here
},
//Blank object as second parameter
{});
```

This pattern will apply to all objects in CanJS that have an extend method.

### The init method
The `init` method is called whenever a new instance of a
can.Construct is created. Init is where the bulk of your initialization code
should go. Inside of the init function, the `this` keyword will refer to the
new instance, and `this` will contain the arguments passed to the
constructor. A common thing to do in init is save the arguments passed into
the constructor. An example is below:

```
var Person = can.Construct.extend({
	init: function(first, last) {
		this.first = first;
		this.last = last;
	}
});

var actor = new Person("Abe", "Vigoda");
```

## First can.Component <a name="first-component"></a>
If you recall from the introduction, a can.Component is like a self-contained, 
mini web application—i.e., it's encapsulated. Because can.Components are
encapsulated, they should each contain their own:

- View template (.stache file)
- JS
- CSS

This is why we created a components folder for our app — instead of, say, a
JS folder. Each component we develop will be in a folder that contains all
the files that support that component. This makes components portable,
enabling you to reuse them across projects. It also isolates them, making
them easier to test and maintain.

In the components folder, create a subfolder called *restaurant_list*, along 
with the following files:

<pre>
| restaurant_list
	|--restaurant_list_component.js
    |--restaurant_list.stache
</pre>

Put the following code inside restaurant_list_component.js:

```
/**
 * @namespace RestaurantListComponent
 */
can.Component.extend({

	tag: 'restaurant-list',
	template: can.view('components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list.stache'),
	scope: {
			currentRestaurant: 'Hello Restaurant Customer'
	}

});
```

Add the following code to restaurant_list.stache:

```
<h1>{{currentRestaurant}}</h1>
```

Add the code below to the /app/base_template.stache file:

```
<restaurant-list></restaurant-list>
```

Next, open up your app.js file, and edit it as follows:

```
$(function () {

	$('#can-app').html(can.view('base_template.stache', {}));

});
```

For the moment, if you don't know what can.view does, don't worry. We'll
go over it in detail soon.

Finally, we need to add a reference to restaurant_list_component.js in the 
index.html file, as follows:

```
<script src="libs/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="libs/can.custom.js"></script>
<script src="libs/can.fixture.js"></script>
  <!--Begin add-->
  <script src="components/restaurant_list/restaurant_list_component.js"></script>
  <!--End add-->
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

Now, go back out to your app in the browser, and refresh it. You should 
see it printing: "Hello Restaurant Customer".

### Auto Instantiation

If you recall from the discussion above regarding can.Construct, whenever you
declare an object using can.Construct, it must be instantiated. Normally, you
would either directly instantiate objects using the `new` keyword, or pass the
constructor to an object that would create instances of it. *can.Component is
an exception*.

All we have to do is declare the can.Component using its `extend` method.
Once you declare your can.Component, you've registered your component with the
system. When CanJS parses the base_template.stache file, and encounters the
restaurant-list tag, it will automatically instantiate the can.Component
associated with it, generate the Component's view inside of its custom tag,
and bind that view to your component's scope.

Let's look at an image that describes how all of this works, to make it
clearer:

### Basic Anatomy of a can.Component
The can.Component we created above had three properties.

- [tag](#tag),
- [template](#template), and
- [scope](#scope)

#### The "tag" Property <a name="tag"></a>
The can.Component's `tag` property associates that
can.Component with a specific, custom HTML tag:

![](../can/guides/images/2_first_component/ComponentTagLinkDiagram.png)

As mentioned above, when the template containing the can.Component's tag is
parsed, the can.Component is instantiated, and the contents of its rendered
template are inserted as the HTML contents of the custom tag:

![](../can/guides/images/2_first_component/ComponentTagRenderedHTML.png)

#### Template <a name="template"></a>
The `template` property of the can.Component contains the string
value of the can.Component's template. Note that the template property just
contains a string value. You can inline the template, if it is small. However,
the recommended way of working with templates, to maintain separation of
concerns, is to keep them in their own files and load them using can.view, as
we have done here.

#### Scope <a name="scope"></a>
The `scope` object is the can.Component's view model. The view
model is an abstraction of the view that exposes public properties and
functions. Any property or method defined on the scope object is available
from the can.Component's template as either a Stache data key, or a function.
In our example above, we created the property "currentRestaurant", and then
referenced it as a Stache data key in our template.

### can.Map &amp; can.List
The scope is a special type of object, called a
"can.Map". can.Map objects are observable. Observable objects provide a way
for you to listen for and keep track of changes to them. What this means, in
this instance, is that if you make a change to your scope, those changes will
be reflected automatically in your view. If you've cross-bound the values
between your scope and your view, changes to your view will also be reflected
in your scope. We'll see how this works in the next chapter.

can.Map objects listen for changes made using their `attr` method. This is
important. In order to broadcast the associated events when you change a
property on a can.Map, you must use the attr method when setting a value.

The attr method can be used to either get or set a property on a can.Map.
`attr` works with deep properties—i.e., properties within properties. Here's
an example:

```
//Get the first property off of the name property off of person
myCanMapInstance.attr('person.name.first');

//Set the last property of the person's name property
myCanMapInstance.attr('person.name.last', 'Bach');
```

Observable arrays are also available with can.List, which is based on can.Map.
