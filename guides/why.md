CanJS is designed to be a very well-rounded JavaScript framework, useful to almost any client-side JavaScript
team.

It provides a wealth of JavaScript utilities that combine to make testable and repeatable Model-View-ViewModel
applications with very little code.  

CanJS provides the default MV\* libraries to the [DoneJS](http://donejs.com) framework.  Checkout DoneJS's [quick
start guide](http://donejs.com/Guide.html) for an example of using CanJS to build a server-side rendered, real-time
chat app that works as an Android, iOS, and Desktop app.

<h2 id="Flexible">Flexible</h2>

CanJS is __flexible__. Unlike other frameworks, it's designed to work in almost any situation.
You can readily use third party plugins or
modify the DOM with jQuery directly.
CanJS supports all browsers.

<h2 id="Powerful">Powerful</h2>

CanJS is __powerful__. Create [custom elements](../docs/can.Component.html) with
[one and two-way bindings](/docs/can.view.bindings.html).
Easily [define](../docs/can.Map.prototype.define.html) the behavior of
observable objects and their derived values. Avoid memory
leaks with smart model stores and smart event binding.  

<h2 id="Fast">Fast</h2>

CanJS is __fast__. It is only about 20k. Its live-binding updates only what needs to be updated without requiring a
"diff".
