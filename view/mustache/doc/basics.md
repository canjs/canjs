## Keys

Keys insert data into the template.  They reference variables
within the current context.  For example:

	{
    		name: "Austin"
	}

	{{name}}

would render:


	"Austin"

## Escaping Values

Mustache will escape values enclosed in a `{{  }}` expression.  For example:
	
	{
		friend: "<strong>Justin</strong>"
	}

	{{friend}}

would return:

	&lt;strong&gt;Justin&lt;/strong&gt;

If you would like Mustache to return the value without 
escaping, use the `{{{  }}}` expression.  For example:

	{{{friend}}}

would return:

	<strong>Justin</strong>

## Paths and Context

When Mustache is resolving a object in a [section](#Sections), the current
context is the value that its iterating. For example:

	{
		friends: [ 'Austin' ]
	}

	{{#friends}}
		{{this}}
	{{/friends}}

__Dot Notation__

The dot notation lets the template reference the current context implicitly.  So taking the above example
we could do:

	{{#friends}}
		{{.}}
	{{/friends}}

and the `.` would represent the 'Austin' value in the array similar to `this` does too.

__Nested Paths__

Mustache supports nested paths, making it possible to look up 
properties nested below the current context.  For example:

	{ 
		book: {
			author: "James Cameron",
			publisher: "Cengage"
		}
	}

then we could reference `author` and `publisher` like so:

	{{book.author}}
	{{book.publisher}}

For keys containing periods, the period should be escaped with `\.`:

	{
		localization: {
			"hello.world": "Hello World!"
		}
	}

	{{localization.hello\.world}}


__Context Jumping__

Internally, Mustache keeps a stack of contexts as the template dives
deeper into nested [sections](#Sections) and [helpers](#Helpers).  If a key is not found within 
the current context, Mustache will look for the key in the parent context
and so on until it resolves the object or reaches the parent most object.  
For example:

	{
		family: [
			{
				name: 'Austin',
				sisters: [
					{
						name: 'Katherine'
					}
				],
				brothers: [
					{
						name: 'Justin'
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}

	{{#family}
		{{#brothers}}
			{{#sisters}}
				{{name}}
			{{/sisters}}
		{{/brothers}}
	{{/family}}

Since `sisters` isn't in the context of the brothers array,
it jumps up to the family object and resolves sisters there.
