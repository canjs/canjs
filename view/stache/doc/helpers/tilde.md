@body

The `~` helper is used to create urls within your application for static resources, such as images. An example usage:

    {{~ "hello/" name ".png"}}

Where `name` is a scope value, this might return `http://example.com/app/hello/world.png` if the application is `http://example.com/app`.

The url to join with is determined by the following factors:

* If attempting to load a relative url, such as `{{~ "../foo.png"}}` and using StealJS the template's address will be used as a reference to look up the location.
* If the `can.baseURL` string is set, this will be used.
* If the `System.baseURL` is set, this will be used.
* Lastly we fall back to `location.pathname`.
