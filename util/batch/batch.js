		 * @function can.batch.start
		 * @parent can.batch
		 * @description Begin an event batch.
		 *
		 * @signature `can.batch.start([batchStopHandler])`
		 *
		 * @param {Function} [batchStopHandler] a callback that gets called after all batched events have been called
		 *
		 * @body
		 * `can.batch.start` causes can.Map to begin an event batch. Until `[can.batch.stop]` is called, any
		 * events that would result from calls to `[can.Map::attr attr]` are held back from firing. If you have
		 * lots of changes to make to can.Maps, batching them together can help performance &emdash; especially if
		 * those can.Maps are live-bound to the DOM.
		 *
		 * In this example, you can see how the _first_ and _change_ events are not fired (and their handlers
		 * are not called) until `can.batch.stop` is called.
		 *
		 * ```
		 * var person = new can.Map({
		 *     first: 'Alexis',
		 *     last: 'Abril'
		 * });
		 *
		 * person.bind('first', function() {
		 *     console.log("First name changed."");
		 * }).bind('change', function() {
		 *     console.log("Something changed.");
		 * });
		 *
		 * can.batch.start();
		 * person.attr('first', 'Alex');
		 * console.log('Still in the batch.');
		 * can.batch.stop();
		 *
		 * // the log has:
		 * // Still in the batch.
		 * // First name changed.
		 * // Something changed.
		 * ```
		 *
		 * You can also pass a callback to `can.batch.start` which will be called after all the events have
		 * been fired:
		 * ```
		 * can.batch.start(function() {
		 *     console.log('The batch is over.');
		 * });
		 * person.attr('first', 'Izzy');
		 * console.log('Still in the batch.');
		 * can.batch.stop();
		 *
		 * // The console has:
		 * // Still in the batch.
		 * // First name changed.
		 * // Something changed.
		 * // The batch is over.
		 * ```
		 *
		 * ## Calling `can.batch.start` multiple times
		 *
		 * If you call `can.batch.start` more than once, `can.batch.stop` needs to be called
		 * the same number of times before any batched events will fire. For ways
		 * to circumvent this process, see [can.batch.stop].
		 *
		 * Here is an example that demonstrates how events are affected by calling
		 * `can.batch.start` multiple times.
		 *
		 * ```
		 * var addPeople = function(observable) {
		 *     can.batch.start();
		 *     observable.attr('a', 'Alice');
		 *     observable.attr('b', 'Bob');
		 *     observable.attr('e', 'Eve');
		 *     can.batch.stop();
		 * };
		 *
		 * // In a completely different place:
		 * var list = new can.Map();
		 * list.bind('change', function() {
		 *     console.log('The list changed.');
		 * });
		 *
		 * can.batch.start();
		 * addPeople(list);
		 * console.log('Still in the batch.');
		 *
		 * // Here, the console has:
		 * // Still in the batch.
		 *
		 * can.batch.stop();
		 *
		 * // Here, the console has:
		 * // Still in the batch.
		 * // The list changed.
		 * // The list changed.
		 * // The list changed.
		 * ```

		 * @function can.batch.stop

		 *

		 * `can.batch.stop` matches an earlier `[can.batch.start]` call. If `can.batch.stop` has been
		 * called as many times as `can.batch.start` (or if _force_ is true), all batched events will be

		 *
		 * See `[can.batch.start]` for examples of `can.batch.start` and `can.batch.stop` in normal use.
