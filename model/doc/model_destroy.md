@description Destroy a Model on the server.
@signature `model.destroy([success[, error]])`
@param {function} [success] A callback to call on successful destruction. The callback recieves
the can.Model as it was just prior to destruction.

@body
Destroys the instance by calling
[Can.Model.destroy] with the id of the instance.

   recipe.destroy(success, error);

This triggers "destroyed" events on the instance and the
Model constructor function which can be listened to with
[can.Model::bind] and [can.Model.bind].

   Recipe = can.Model.extend({
     destroy : "DELETE /services/recipes/{id}",
     findOne : "/services/recipes/{id}"
   },{})

   Recipe.bind("destroyed", function(){
     console.log("a recipe destroyed");
   });

   // get a recipe
   Recipe.findOne({id: 5}, function(recipe){
     recipe.bind("destroyed", function(){
       console.log("this recipe destroyed")
     })
     recipe.destroy();
   })
