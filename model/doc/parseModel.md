@body

## Use

`can.Model.parseModel(data, xhr)` is used to
convert the raw response of a [can.Model.findOne findOne],
[can.Model.update update], and [can.Model.create create] request
into an object that [can.Model.model] can use to create
a model instances.

This method is never called directly. Instead the deferred returned
by `findOne`, `update`, and `create` is piped into `parseModel`. If `findOne` was called,
the result of that is sent to [can.Model.model].

If your server is returning data in non-standard way,
overwriting `can.Model.parseModel` is the best way to normalize it.

## Expected data format

By default, [can.Model.model] expects data to be a name-value pair
object like:

   {id: 1, name : "dishes"}

If your data does not look like this, you probably want to overwrite `parseModel`.

## Overwriting parseModel

If your service returns data like:

   { thingsToDo: {name: "dishes", id: 5} }

You will want to overwrite `parseModel` to pass the model what it expects like:

   Task = can.Model.extend({
     parseModel: function(data){
       return data.thingsToDo;
     }
   },{});

You could also do this like:

   Task = can.Model.extend({
     parseModel: "thingsToDo"
   },{});
