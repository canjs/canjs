@function can.compute
@parent canjs

@description Create an observable value.

@signature `can.compute( getterSetter[, context] )`

Create a compute that derives its value from [can.Map]s and other [can.computed can.compute]s.

@param {function(*+,*+)} getterSetter(newVal,oldVal) A function that gets and optionally sets the value of the compute.
When called with no parameters, _getterSetter_ should return the current value of the compute. When
called with a single parameter, _getterSetter_ should arrange things so that the next read of the compute
produces that value. This compute will automatically update its value when any [can.Map observable]
values are read via [can.Map.prototype.attr].

@param {Object} [context] The `this` to use when calling the `getterSetter` function.
@return {can.computed} A new compute.


@signature `can.compute( initialValue [, settings] )`

Creates a compute from a value and optionally specifies how to read, update, and 
listen to changes in dependent values. This form of can.compute can be used to 
create a compute that derives its value from any source.

@param {*} initialValue The initial value of the compute. If `settings` is
not provided, the compute simply updates its value to whatever the first argument 
to the compute is.

    var age = can.compute(30);
    age() //-> 30
    age(31) //-> fires a "change" event

@param {{get: function, set: function, on: function, off: function}} [settings]

Configures all behaviors of the [can.computed compute]. The following cross
binds an input element to a compute:

    var input = document.getElementById("age")
    var value = can.compute("",{
		get: function(){
			return input.value;
		},
		set: function(newVal){
			input.value = newVal;
		},
		on: function(updated){
			input.addEventListener("change", updated, false);
		},
		off: function(updated){
			input.removeEventListener("change", updated, false);
		}
	})

@option {function} get A function that retrieves and returns the current value
of the compute.

@option {function(*,*):*} set(newVal,oldVal)

A function that is called when a compute is called with an argument. The function is passed
the first argumented passed to [can.computed compute] and the current value. If
`set` returns a value, it is used to compare to the current value of the compute. Otherwise,
`get` is called to get the current value of the compute and that value is used
to determine if the compute has changed values.

@option {function(function)} on(updated) Called to setup binding to dependency events. Call updated
when the computes value needs to be updated.

@option {function(function)} off Called to teardown binding.

@return {can.computed} The new compute.



@signature `can.compute( initialValue, setter(newVal,oldVal) )`

Create a compute that has a setter that can adjust incoming new values.

    var age = can.compute(6,function(newVal, oldVal){
      if(!isNaN(+newVal)){
        return +newVal;
      } else {
        return oldVal;
      }
    })



@param {*} initialValue

The initial value of the compute.

@param {function(*,*):*} setter(newVal,oldVal) 

A function that is called when a compute is called with an argument. The function is passed
the first argumented passed to [can.computed compute] and the current value. If
`set` returns a value, it is used to compare to the current value of the compute. Otherwise,
`get` is called to get the current value of the compute and that value is used
to determine if the compute has changed values.

@return {can.computed} A new compute.

@signature `can.compute( object, propertyName [, eventName] )`

Create a compute from an object's property value. This short-cut
signature lets you create a compute on objects that have events
that be listened to with [can.bind].

    var input = document.getElementById('age')
    var age = can.compute(input,"value","change");
    
    var me = new can.Map({name: "Justin"});
    var name = can.compute(me,"name")

@param {Object} object An object that either has a `bind` method or
a has events dispatched on it via [can.trigger].

@param {String} propertyName The property value to read on `object`.  The
property will be read via `object.attr(propertyName)` or `object[propertyame]`.

@param {String} [eventName=propertyName] Specifies the event name to listen
to on `object` for `propertyName` updates.

@return {can.computed} A new compute.

## Use

`can.compute` lets you make an observable value. Computes are similar
to [can.Map Observes], but they represent a single value rather than 
a collection of values.

`can.compute` returns a [can.computed compute] function that can 
be called to read and optionally update the compute's value.

It's also possible to derive a compute's value from other computes,
[can.Map]s, and [can.List]s. When the derived values
change, the compute's value will be automatically updated.

Use [can.computed.bind compute.bind] to listen for changes of the 
compute's value.

## Observing a value

The simplest way to use a compute is to have it store a single value, and to set it when
that value needs to change:


    var tally = can.compute(12);
    tally(); // 12
    
    tally.bind("change",function(ev, newVal, oldVal){
      console.log(newVal,oldVal)
    })
    
    tally(13);
    tally(); // 13

Any value can be observed.  The following creates a compute
that holds an object and then changes it to an array.

    var data = can.compute({name: "Justin"})
    data([{description: "Learn Computes"}])



## Derived computes

If you use a compute that derives its
value from properties of a [can.Map] or other [can.compute]s, the compute will listen for changes in those
properties and automatically recalculate itself, emitting a _change_ event if its value
changes.

The following example shows creating a `fullName` compute
that derives its value from two properties on the `person` observe:


    var person = new can.Map({
        firstName: 'Alice',
        lastName: 'Liddell'
    });
    
    var fullName = can.compute(function() {
        return person.attr('firstName') + ' ' + person.attr('lastName');
    });
    fullName.bind('change', function(ev, newVal, oldVal) {
        console.log("This person's full name is now " + newVal + '.');
    });
    
    person.attr('firstName', 'Allison'); // The log reads:
    //-> "This person's full name is now Allison Liddell."


Notice how the definition of the compute uses `[can.Map.prototype.attr attr]`
to read the values of the properties of `person`. This is how the compute knows to listen
for changes.

## Translator computes - computes that update their derived values

Sometimes you need a compute to be able to translate one value to another. For example,
consider a widget that displays and allows you to update the progress in percent
of a task. It accepts a compute with values between 0 and 100. But,
our task observe has progress values between 0 and 1 like:

    var task = new can.Map({
      progress: 0.75
    })

Use `can.compute( getterSetter )` to create a compute that updates itself
when task's `progress` changes, but can also update progress when
the compute function is called with a value.  For example:

    var progressPercent = can.compute(function(percent){
      if(arguments.length){
        task.attr('progress', percent / 100)
      } else {
        return task.attr('progress') * 100
      }
    })
    
    progressPercent() // -> 75
    
    progressPercent(100)
    
    task.attr('progress') // -> 1


The following is a similar example that shows converting feet into meters and back:

@codestart
var wall = new can.Map({
    material: 'brick',
    length: 10 // in feet
});

var wallLengthInMeters = can.compute(function(lengthInM) {
    if(arguments.length) {
        wall.attr('length', lengthInM / 3.28084);
    } else {
        return wall.attr('length') * 3.28084;
    }
});

wallLengthInMeters(); // 3.048

// When you set the compute...
wallLengthInMeters(5);
wallLengthInMeters(); // 5
// ...the original Observe changes too.
wall.length;          // 16.4042
@codeend

## Events

When a compute's value is changed, it emits a _change_ event. You can listen for this change
event by using `[can.computed.bind bind]` to bind an event handler to the compute:

@codestart
var tally = can.compute(0);
tally.bind('change', function(ev, newVal, oldVal) {
    console.log('The tally is now at ' + newVal + '.');
});

tally(tally() + 5); // The log reads:
                    // 'The tally is now at 5.'
@codeend

## Using computes to build Controls

It's a piece of cake to build a `[can.Control]` off of the value of a compute. And since computes
are observable, it means that the view of that Control will update itself whenever the value
of the compute updates. Here's a simple slider that works off of a compute:

@codestart
var project = new Observe({
    name: 'A Very Important Project',
    percentDone: .35
});

SimpleSlider = can.Control.extend({ }, {
    init: function() {
        this.element.html(can.view(this.options.view, this.options));
    },
    '.handle dragend': function(el, ev) {
        var percent = this.calculateSliderPercent();
        // set the compute's value
        this.options.percentDone(percent);
    },
    '{percentDone} change': function(ev, newVal, oldVal) {
	       // react to the percentage changing some other way
        this.moveSliderTo(newVal);
    }
    // Implementing calculateSliderPercent and moveSliderTo
    // has been left as an exercise for the reader.
});

new SimpleSlider('#slider', {percentDone: project.compute('percentDone')});
@codeend

Now that's some delicious cake. More information on Controls can be found under `[can.Control]`.
There is also a full explanation of can.Map's `[can.Map.prototype.compute compute]`,
which is used in the last line of the example above.
