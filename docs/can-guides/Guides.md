@description Welcome to CanJS! These guides are here to help you develop and improve your relationship with
CanJS. After all, picking a JavaScript framework is a commitment.  We want CanJS to be the
framework you marry.  This page helps you know how to advance through the different stages of this
relationship:

## Introduction

If you’re reading this, you’ve already taken the first step. You’ve met CanJS!  Maybe you
heard about it at a meetup, or read about it on a blog, but before you spend any time with it, you want to know “who is CanJS?”

CanJS is part of the DoneJS family of open source projects.  The [DoneJS Team](https://donejs.com/About.html#section=section_Team) and [Bitovi](http://bitovi.com)
are responsible for CanJS. They steer its direction, add features, fix bugs, and help
you become successful. Feel free to say hello anytime on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) or the [forums](http://forums.donejs.com/c/canjs).

CanJS’s goals are briefly summarized in its mission statement:

> To minimize the cost of building and maintaining JavaScript applications.

Read more on [guides/mission] about our mission and how we’ve been accomplishing those goals for
10 years.

If CanJS’s heart isn’t enough to convince you it’s a good fit, read up on its
[guides/technical].


## Experimenting

So now you’ve decided to give CanJS a try.
The best place to start is the [guides/chat].
It’s only an hour and shows off CanJS’s best features while you build
a real time chat application.  You build the whole thing in a JSBin.

Next, you’ll want to try the [guides/todomvc].  This takes about 1.5 hours and touches on
every core part of CanJS.  You can also follow the whole guide in a JSBin.

After that, check out the [guides/atm].  It takes about 2 hours and shows how to build and __test__
an ATM machine. It also shows how to composite state.  The whole guide is done in a JSBin.

You might also want to to go through DoneJS’s [Place My Order Guide](https://donejs.com/place-my-order.html).  This is an in-depth
look at how CanJS works within the context of a wide variety of other tools.  This guide takes
about 8 hours.

Finally, when you’re just about to commit, read [guides/setup] to learn how to setup
CanJS for your particular environment.

## Commitment

Once you’ve committed to CanJS, it’s important that you keep liking it and
get better at using it.  

CanJS’s community has lots of people who can offer advice and tips on
how to build an application in the right way. Instead of struggling,
please ask for advice on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) or the [forums](http://forums.donejs.com/c/canjs).  Share a screen-shot of what you’re building
and we’ll tell you what needs to be done.

To stay up on CanJS’s latest news, we suggest:

 - Following [@CanJS](https://twitter.com/canjs) on twitter.
 - Subscribing to Bitovi’s [development blog](https://www.bitovi.com/blog/topic/development).

area.  It shows off how to accomplish common UI and architectural patterns with the framework.

## Contributing

Once you’ve settled down with CanJS, it’s time to think about adding extensions and improvements to the framework of your own. There are many ways to contribute to
CanJS, including:

 - [guides/contributing/bug-report Report a bug]
 - [guides/contributing/feature-suggestion Suggest a feature]
 - [guides/contributing/code Code changes]

CanJS is managed by the [DoneJS Contributors Team](https://donejs.com/About.html#section=section_Team).
All contributions from all types of contributors are welcome. Contributing
to an Open Source project can be an intimidating experience.  We’re
committed to making the experience as pleasant and rewarding as possible.  We’re happy to setup a
pairing session to show you how to fix a bug or write a feature.  

If you have any questions, you can always reach us on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs).

If you want to become a CanJS contributor, you simply have to:

 - [Email](mailto:contact@bitovi.com) the core team expressing your interest.

 - Make one small contribution, even a spelling correction, a month.

Issues that should be easy for a new contribitor to pick up have an “easy” label. [This GitHub search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Acanjs+is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AEasy&type=Issues) makes it easy to find easy issues across all the CanJS repositories.
