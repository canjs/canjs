## Introduction

If you're reading this, you've already taken the first step. You've met CanJS!  Maybe you
heard about it at a meetup, or read about it on a blog. But before you spend any time with it, you want to know, "who is CanJS?".

CanJS is part of the DoneJS family of open source projects.  The [DoneJS Team](https://donejs.com/About.html#section=section_Team) along with [Bitovi](http://bitovi.com)
are the people most responsible for CanJS's direction, adding features, fixing bugs, and helping
you become successful. Feel free to say hello anytime on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) or the [forums](http://forums.donejs.com/c/canjs).

You'll also want to know what CanJS stands for. Checkout our mission statement:

> CanJS is an evolving and improving set of client side JavaScript architectural libraries that balances innovation and stability.
> CanJS targets experienced developers building complex applications with long futures ahead of them.

Read more on [guides/mission] about our mission and how we've been accomplishing those goals for
10 years.

Finally, if CanJS's heart isn't enough to convince you it's a good fit, read up on its
[guides/technical].


## Experimenting

So now you've decided to give CanJS a try.
The best place to start is the [guides/chat].
It's only an hour, and CanJS will be showing off all of it's best features while you build
a real time chat application.  You build the whole thing in a JSBin.

Next, you'll want to try the [guides/todomvc].  This takes about 1.5 hours and touches on
every core part of CanJS.  You can also follow the whole guide in a JSBin.

After that, checkout the [guides/atm].  It takes about 2 hours and shows how to build and __test__
an ATM machine. It also shows how to composite state.  The whole guide is done in a JSBin.

You might also want to to go through DoneJS's [Place My Order Guide](https://donejs.com/place-my-order.html).  This is a very in-depth
look at how CanJS works within the context of a wide variety of other tools.  This guide takes
about 8 hours.

Finally, when you're just about to commit, read [guides/setup] to learn how to setup
CanJS for your particular environment.

## Commitment

Once you've committed to CanJS, it's important that you keep liking it and
get better at using it.  

CanJS's community has a wealth of people who can offer advice and tips on
how to build an application in the right way. Instead of struggling,
please ask for advice on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) or the [forums](http://forums.donejs.com/c/canjs).  Share a screen-shot of what you're building
and we'll tell you what needs to be done.
