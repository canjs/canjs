<div class="getting-started">

We’ve come a long way since we started developing our first CanJS application.
Nice work! Together, we’ve covered:

- The recommended application structure.
- Building a `can.Component`.
- Binding to templates with `can.view`.
- Accessing service-exposed data with `can.Model`.
- Interrupting service calls to mimic server responses with `can.fixture`.
- Tying the application together with an Application State object.
- Binding the Application State object with the base template, and the
  application's route to enable routing.

Those are all the pieces you need to start building applications with CanJS
today.
