## The Goal

We are building the following functionality:

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="bitovi" data-slug-hash="YgQXZE" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CanJS 5.0 Chat - Final">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bitovi/pen/YgQXZE/">
  CanJS 5.0 Chat - Final</a> by Bitovi (<a href="https://codepen.io/bitovi">@bitovi</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

## Setup

The easiest way to get started is to _Fork_ the following CodePen by clicking the __Edit On CodePen__ button on the top right:

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="bitovi" data-slug-hash="VRWLbM" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CanJS 5.0 Chat - Start">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bitovi/pen/VRWLbM/">
  CanJS 5.0 Chat - Start</a> by Bitovi (<a href="https://codepen.io/bitovi">@bitovi</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

The CodePen is configured to load [https://getbootstrap.com/ Bootstrap] for its styles and [https://socket.io/ socket.io] for a socket
library.  It will be connecting to a RESTful and real-time service layer at [https://chat.donejs.com/api/messages].

The CodePen also importing [guides/setup##ImportingthecoreESmodulebundle core.mjs], which exports all of CanJS's [can-core] APIs as named exports. The following is how
you can import different APIs into your app:

```js
import {DefineMap, Component} from "//unpkg.com/can@5/core.mjs"
```

Read [guides/setup] for instructions on how to set up CanJS in a real app.
Check out [https://donejs.com/Guide.html the DoneJS version of this guide].



## Hello World

In this section, we will:

 - Show a big “Chat Home” title within a Bootstrap container.
 - Make it so when “Chat Home” is clicked, an exclamation mark (“!”) is added to the end of the title.

In your CodePen, update the `HTML` panel to:

 - Use the `<chat-app>` element we will define in the `JS` panel.


@sourceref ./1-hello-world/html.html
@highlight 1

Update the `JavaScript` panel to:

 - Define an application component (`chat-app`) by extending [can-component]. Its definition includes:
   - A `tag` that is the name of the custom element being defined.
   - A [can-stache] `view` that contains the contents of the `chat-app` element.  This view:
     - Inserts a `message` value within a responsive Bootstrap container using [can-stache.tags.escaped].
     - Listen for `click` events and call `addExcitement` with [can-stache-bindings.event].
   - A [can-define/map/map] `ViewModel` definition.  This definition includes:
     - A `message` property that is a [can-define.types string]
       value [can-define.types.default initialized] to `"Chat Home"`.
     - An `addExcitement` method that adds `"!"` to the end of the `message` property.

@sourceref ./1-hello-world/js.js
@highlight 1,3-26

When complete, you should see a large “Chat Home” title in the `Output` panel.  Click on it and
things will get really exciting!

<video controls>
   <source src="../../docs/can-guides/experiment/chat/1-hello-world/completed.webm" type="video/webm">
   <source src="../../docs/can-guides/experiment/chat/1-hello-world/completed.ogg" type="video/ogg">
</video>

This step sets up the essential basics of a CanJS application — a [can-component]
custom element with a [can-stache] view and [can-define/map/map] ViewModel.

The properties and methods the `view` uses are defined in the `ViewModel`
type.  We defined a `message` and an `addExcitement` method.

The templates are a dialect of [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) and [handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/) syntax.  The
mustache syntax allows a very terse writing style for the most common
patterns within templates:

 - inserting data with [can-stache.tags.escaped]
 - looping with [can-stache.helpers.each]
 - branching with [can-stache.helpers.if] or [can-stache.helpers.is]



> __Key take-away:__ You define `ViewModel` method and property behaviors.
> The `ViewModel` methods can be called by [can-stache] `view`s.  The `ViewModel`
> properties can be observed by [can-stache] `view`s.


## Route between two pages

In this section we will:

 - Create a __home page__ and __chat messages page__ that the user can navigate between
   with links and the browser’s back and forward button.

Update the `JavaScript` panel to:

- Update the `chat-app` component's `view` to:
  - Check if the `ViewModel`’s `routeData.page` property is `"home"`.  If it is, render the __home
    page__’s content.  If it’s not, it will render the __chat messages page__’s content with the   [can-stache.helpers.else] helper.
  - Use [can-stache-route-helpers.routeUrl] to create the right link URLs so that `page`
    will be set on [can-route.data route.data] to either `"home"` or `"chat"`.
- Update the `chat-app` component's `ViewModel` to:
  - Setup a connection between the [can-route.data route.data] state and the `ViewModel`’s `routeData` property by:
    - Defining a `routeData` property with a [can-define.types.default] value
	  that returns the [can-route.data route.data].
    - Create a pretty routing rule so if the URL looks like `"#!chat"`, the `page` property of
      [can-route.data route.data] will be set to `chat` with [can-route.register].  If there is nothing in the hash, `page`
      will be set to `"home"`.
    - Initialize the url’s values on [can-route.data route.data] and set up the two-way connection with
      [can-route.start].


@sourceref ./2-routing/js.js
@highlight 1,9-22,32-38,only

When complete, you should be able to toggle between the two pages.  If you type:

```
window.location.hash
```

in CodePen’s console tab after clicking a new page, you will be able to see the hash change between `!#` and `#!chat`.


This step sets up basic routing between different “pages” in an application.
CanJS’s routing is based on the values accessible to the application ViewModel.  When
those properties change, different content is shown.  

We connected the application ViewModel to the routing system by having the
ViewModel's `routeData` property return [can-route.data can-route.data].
We initialized that connection between [can-route.data can-route.data] and the url with [can-route.start can-route.start].

This makes it so if the `routeData.page` property changes, the browser’s URL will change.  If the browser’s URL changes, the `routeData.page` property changes.  

> __Key take-away:__  [can-route] two-way binds changes in the browser’s URL to
the application ViewModel and vice versa.  Use changes in
the application ViewModel to control which content is shown.


## Chat Messages Component

In this section, we will:

- Define and use a custom `<chat-messages>` element that contains the behavior of the __chat messages page__.

Update the `JavaScript` panel to:

- Define a `<chat-messages>` custom element with [can-component].  It's `view` will
  contain the content of the __chat messages page__.
- Update `<chat-app>`’s `view` to create a `<chat-messages>` element.

@sourceref ./3-chat-messages/js.js
@highlight 3-10,27,only

When complete, you should see the same behavior as the previous step. You should
be able to click back and forth between the two different pages.


This step creates the `<chat-messages>` custom element.  Custom elements are used
to represent some grouping of related (and typically visual) functionality such as:

 - Widgets like `<my-slider>` or `<acme-navigation>`.
 - Pages like `<chat-login>` or `<chat-messages>`.

Custom elements are the macroscopic building blocks of an application.  They
are the [orchestration pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing))
used to assemble the application into a whole.  

For example, an application’s template might assemble many custom elements
to work together like:

```html
{{# if(session) }}
  <app-toolbar selectedFiles:bind="selectedFiles"/>
  <app-directory selectedFiles:bind="selectedFiles"/>
  <app-files selectedFiles:bind="selectedFiles"/>
  <app-file-details selectedFiles:bind="selectedFiles"/>
{{ else }}
  <app-login/>
{{/ if }}
```

Breaking down an application into many isolated and potentially reusable components
is a critical piece of CanJS software architecture.

Custom elements are defined with [can-component].  Components render their `view`
with a `ViewModel` instance.  By default, their `view` only
has access to the data in the `ViewModel`.  You can use [can-stache-bindings event and data bindings]
like [can-stache-bindings.toChild] and [can-stache-bindings.twoWay] to pass data
between custom elements.

> __Key take-away:__  [can-component] makes custom elements. Break down your application
into many bite-sized custom elements.

## List Messages

In this section, we will:

 - Display messages from [https://chat.donejs.com/api/messages](https://chat.donejs.com/api/messages) when `messagesPromise.isResolved`.
 - Show a “Loading…” message while the messages are loading (`messagesPromise.isPending`).
 - Show an error if those messages fail to load (`messagesPromise.isRejected`).


Update the `JavaScript` panel to:

 - Define a `Message` type with [can-define/map/map].
 - Define a `Message.List` type that contains `Message` items.
 - Connect the `Message` and `Message.List` type to
   the RESTful messages service at `https://chat.donejs.com/api/messages`
   using [can-realtime-rest-model].
 - Update the `<chat-messages>`’s `view` to:
   - Check if the messages are in the process of loading and show a loading indicator.
   - Check if the messages failed to load and display the reason for the failure.
   - If messages successfully loaded, list each message’s name and body.  If there
      are no messages, write out “No messages”.
 - Update the `<chat-messages>`’s `ViewModel` to:
   - Define a `messagesPromise` property on `ChatMessagesVM` that’s
     [can-define.types.default] is initialized to a   [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
     that represents the loading of all messages using [can-connect/can/map/map.getList].

@sourceref ./4-list-messages/js.js
@highlight 1,3-21,30-60,only

When complete, you should see a list of messages in the __chat messages page__.

This step creates a `Message` model by first creating the `Message` type
and then connecting it to a messages service at `https://chat.donejs.com/api/messages`.

### Explanation

The [can-realtime-rest-model] mixin adds [can-connect/can/map/map methods] to the `Message` type that let you:

 - Get a list of messages:
   ```js
   Message.getList({}).then(function(messages){})
   ```

 - Get a single message:
   ```js
   Message.get({id: 5}).then(function(message){})
   ```
 - Create a message on the server:
   ```js
   message = new Message({name: "You", body: "Hello World"})
   message.save()
   ```
 - Update a message on the server:
   ```js
   message.body = "Welcome Earth!";
   message.save();
   ```
 - Delete message on the server:
   ```js
   message.destroy();
   ```

There are also methods to let you know when a message
[can-connect/can/map/map.prototype.isNew],
[can-connect/can/map/map.prototype.isSaving], and
[can-connect/can/map/map.prototype.isDestroying].

With the message model created, it’s used to load and list messages on the server.


> __Key take-away:__ Create a model for your data’s schema and use it to communicate with a backend server.

## Create Messages

In this section, we will:

- Add the ability to create messages on the server and have them added to the list of messages.


Update the `<chat-messages>` __view__ to:

 - Create a form to enter a message’s `name` and `body`.
 - When the form is submitted, call `send` on the `ChatMessagesVM` with [can-stache-bindings.event].
 - Connect the first `<input>`’s `value` to the `ChatMessagesVM`’s `name` property with [can-stache-bindings.twoWay].
 - Connect the second `<input>`’s `value` to the `ChatMessagesVM`’s `body` property with [can-stache-bindings.twoWay].

Update the `<chat-messages>` __ViewModel__ to:

- Define a `name` and `body` property on `ChatMessagesVM`.
- Define a `send` method on `ChatMessagesVM` that creates a new `Message` and sends it to the server.

@sourceref ./5-create-messages/js.js
@highlight 55-67,75-88,only

When complete, you will be able to create messages and have them appear in the list.

This step sets up a form to create a `Message` on the server.
Notice that the new `Message` automatically appears in the list of messages. This
is because [can-realtime-rest-model] adds the [can-connect/real-time/real-time] behavior.  The
[can-connect/real-time/real-time] behavior automatically inserts newly created messages into
lists that they belong within.  This is one of CanJS’s best features — automatic list management.

> __Key take-away:__ CanJS will add, remove, and update lists for you automatically.

## Real Time

In this section, we will:

 - Listen to messages created by other users and add them to the list of messages.

Update the `JavaScript` panel to:

- Create a [https://socket.io/] connection (`socket`).
- Listen for when messages are created, updated, and destroyed, and call the
  corresponding [can-connect/real-time/real-time] methods.

@sourceref ./6-real-time/js.js
@highlight 23-33,only

When complete, you can open up the same CodePen in another window, create a
message, and it will appear in the first CodePen’s messages list.

This step connects to a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API WebSocket API]
that pushes messages when `Message`s are created, updated or destroyed. By calling the
[can-connect/real-time/real-time] methods when these events happen, CanJS will automatically
update the messages list.

> __Key take-away:__ CanJS will add, remove, and update lists for you automatically.  It’s
awesome!

## Result

When finished, you should see something like the following CodePen:

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="bitovi" data-slug-hash="YgQXZE" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CanJS 5.0 Chat - Final">
