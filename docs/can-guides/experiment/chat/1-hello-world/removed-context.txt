We then created an instance of the `appVM` with the `new` operator. This created
an object with a `message` property and `addExcitement` method.  For example, adding:

```js
console.log(appVM.message)
appVM.addExcitement();
console.log(appVM.message)
```

Will print out `"Chat Home"` and then `"Chat Home!"`.

[can-define/map/map DefineMap] instances are observable.  This is why when `message` changes,
the template updates automatically.
