@description Learn how to debug CanJS applications.

@body

CanJS has many utilities that help you understand how an application behaves and
discover common problems. This guide is a central list for those utilities. It introduces
those utilities and highlights when they are useful.

For a step-by-step walkthrough and video, check out the [CanJS Debugging tuturial](https://www.bitovi.com/blog/canjs-debugging-tutorial) on [bitovi.com](https://www.bitovi.com/blog/).

## Set Up Debugging

CanJS does not have a single global export; instead, every module must be imported. While this
improves longevity, it makes access to debugging utilities difficult. The [can-debug]
package adds a `can` object to the global window, making all of CanJS’s packages
available.

For example, `can-queue`’s [can-queues.logStack] method can be called like:

```js
import { queues } from "can";
queues.logStack();
```

However, if any part of your application enables [can-debug], you can log the stack like:

```js
can.queues.logStack()
```
The following sections show how to enable [can-debug] using ES Modules, StealJS, and Webpack:

### ES Module Setup

If you are using the [core](guides/setup.html#ImportingthecoreESmodulebundle) or [ecosystem](guides/setup.html#ImportingtheecosystemESmodulebundle) ES module bundle, [can-debug] will be enabled automatically.

> **Note:** When first accessing properties on the global `can`, a warning will be logged. This is to discourage
> relying on the global `can` object.

Debugging is not enabled automatically with the minified ES module bundles. To enable it, you will need to import [can-debug] from the ecosystem bundle and enable it yourself:

```js
import { debug } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/ecosystem.min.mjs";
debug();
```

### StealJS setup

StealJS supports two ways of loading `can-debug` only in production:

- `//!steal-remove-start` comments
- conditional modules

#### Using steal-remove-start comments

Add the following to your main module:

```js
//!steal-remove-start
import { debug } from "can";
debug();
//!steal-remove-end
```

> **Note:** You can also do this using [individual packages](guides/setup.html#Installingindividualpackages)
> with `import debug from "can-debug";`

#### Conditional loading

StealJS's [conditional loading](https://stealjs.com/docs/steal-conditional.html) makes it possible to load a module only when another module’s export evaluates to `true`. 


First, install [steal-conditional](https://stealjs.com/docs/steal-conditional.html):

```
npm install steal-conditional --save-dev
```

And update the `steal` part of your `package.json` to include the following:

```
"steal": {
  "configDependencies": [
    "./node_modules/steal-conditional/conditional"
  ]
}
```

Next, create an `is-dev` module:

```js
// is-dev.js
export default !steal.isEnv("production");
```

Then we can conditionally load modules like:

```js
import debug from "can-debug#?is-dev";
if (debug) {
	debug();
}
```

### WebPack Setup

To import the debug module only in development, add the following
code to your main module:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
    const debug = require("can-debug");
	debug();
}
```

Then, make sure `process.env` is defined in `webpack.config.js`
with the following:

```js
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
    ...
    plugins: [
        new webpack.DefinePlugin({
            "process.env": {
                NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify("production")
            }
        })
    ]
};
```

## Provide useful debugger names

CanJS tries to create useful names to help identify the objects and
functions in your application. It uses [can-reflect]’s [can-reflect.getName]
to return a useful debugger name. By default objects are named using the following convention:

- The name starts with the observable constructor name, ex: [can-define/map/map DefineMap].
- The constructor name is decorated with the following characters based on its type:
  - `<>`: for value-like observables, ex: `SimpleObservable<>`
  - `[]`: for list-like observables, ex: `DefineList[]`
  - `{}`: for map-like observables, ex: `DefineMap{}`
- Any property that makes the instance unique (like ids) are printed inside the characters mentioned before.

You can assist by naming your types and functions wherever possible. The follow sections list how:

#### Provide a name to types built with [can-construct]

If you are using [can-map], [can-define/map/map] or any other package that inherits from [can-construct],
name your function by passing `.extend` a name as the first argument:

```js
import { DefineMap } from "can";

export default DefineMap.extend("TheNameOfMyType", { /* ... */ })
```

#### Label instances

[can-reflect]’s [can-reflect.setName] method can be used to uniquely name a particular object:

```js
can.reflect.setName(person, "Person{Justin}");
```

#### Name anonymous functions

If you bind to an observable, instead of an anonymous function handler, use function declarations or named function
expressions:

```js
// INSTEAD OF THIS:
map.on("key", function(ev, newVal) { /* ... */ })

// DO THIS:
map.on("key", function keyChanged(ev, newVal) { /* ... */ })
```

Similarly, if you create [can-compute]s or [can-observation]s yourself, make sure the function
passed has a name:

```js
// INSTEAD OF THIS:
new Observation(function(){
    return map.first + " " + map.last;
});

// DO THIS:
new Observation(function fullName(){
    return map.first + " " + map.last;
});
```

> **Note:** If your function is a property on an observable map or list like [can-define/map/map],
> you don't have to name it. For example, CanJS will name the `fullName` getter in the following example:
> ```js
> DefineMap.extend("Person",{
>   fullName: {
>     get: function(){ return this.first + " " + this.last; }
>   }
> })
> ```


## Debug what caused a observable event or update to happen.

Your browser's developer tools provide a stack trace that represents
what caused the current function to run.

However, what caused a function to
run isn't always obvious by looking at the stack trace because CanJS runs
functions within [can-queues].

Consider the following code that derives an info value from the person observable:

```js
const person = new observe.Object({name: "Fran", age: 15});

const info = new Observation(function updateInfo(){
    return person.name + " is " + person.age;
});

info.on(function onInfoChanged(newVal){
    debugger;
})

person.age = 22;
```

Say you wanted to know why `onInfoChanged` was called, so you inserted the `debugger` above. When
the debugger was hit, you can enter [can-queues.logStack] in the console to see the enqueued tasks that resulted
in `onInfoChanged` being run:

```js
can.queues.logStack();
```

The following video shows using `logStack`:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0hR5ic_FvE" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


[can-queues.log can.queues.log] can be used to log when a
task is enqueued and flushed. Often, you only want to log when
tasks are run. This can be done with:

```js
can.queues.log("flush")
```

Both `queues.logStack()` and `queues.log()` log the function
that was run, its context (`this`), arguments and a `meta`
object that includes information such as why the task
was enqueued.

## Understand what changes an observable or what an observable changes.

[can-debug]’s [can-debug.logWhatChangesMe] logs the observables
that change a value. It logs both:

- observables that mutate the value through CanJS libraries (example: `<component viewModelProp:from="value">`).
- observables that are source values from a computed property
  (example: `get fullName(){ return this.first + " " + this.last }`

You can log what changes CanJS observables and DOM elements:

```js
can.debug.logWhatChangesMe(me, "fullName");
can.debug.logWhatChangesMe(document.querySelector("h1.name"));
```

[can-debug]’s [can-debug.logWhatIChange] reverses [can-debug.logWhatChangesMe]
and logs what observables are changed by an observable value:

```js
can.debug.logWhatIChange(me, "first");
can.debug.logWhatIChange(document.querySelector("input[name=first]"));
```

Finally, [using CanJS Devtools](#UsingtheCanJSDevtoolsBindingsGraph) these relationships can be seen in a graph like the following:

<img src="../../node_modules/can-debug/doc/map-dependency-graph.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="A visual representation of an observable's dependency graph"
  width="600px"/>

## Access a component's view-model.

Use [can-view-model] to access a component's viewModel:

```js
can.viewModel(document.querySelector("my-component"));
```

## Log when an observable changes.

Most of CanJS’s observables have a log method that can be used to log when its state changes:

```js
map.log();
```

This can be quite useful when used with [can-view-model]:

```js
can.viewModel(document.querySelector("my-component")).log();
```

CanJS’s observable map-types like [can-define/map/map] can be passed
a property name and log when that property changes:

```js
map.log("property");
```

## Debug [can-stache] issues

[can-stache] has two utilities for debugging:

- [can-stache.helpers.debugger] - Break within a template.
- [can-stache.helpers.console] - Call the debugger console methods.

[can-stache.helpers.debugger] can be used a variety of ways:

```
Break anytime this part of the template evaluates
{{debugger()}}

Break when condition is truthy
{{debugger(condition)}}

Break when left equals right
{{debugger(left, right)}}
```

When debugger breaks, you have access to the scope and a special `get` function that lets you inspect values in the [can-view-scope scope].

Stache templates also have access the [can-stache.helpers.console] methods, making it
easy to log value or even test performance.

```js
{{#if tasksPromise.isResolved}}
  {{ console.log("tasks resolved with", tasksPromise.value) }}
{{/if}}
```

`console` methods will be called whenever the template would normally update the
DOM. This means that `count` will be logged every second in the following component:

```js
Component.extend({
    tag: "my-counter",
    view: `{{console.log(count)}}`,
    ViewModel: {
        count: {
            value({resolve}) {
                let count = resolve(0);
                setInterval(() => {
                    resolve(++count);
                }, 1000);
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Installing CanJS Devtools

There is a CanJS Devtools Chrome Extension available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canjs-devtools/hhdfadlgplkpapjfehnjhcebebgmibcb).

Once installed, a CanJS icon will be displayed next to the address bar:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/canjs-button-disabled.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools extension icon - disabled"
  width="600px"/>

Initially, this icon will be disabled. In order to enable the extension, [can-debug] 2.0.0 or higher must be installed as explained in [Set Up Debugging](#SetUpDebugging). Once this is set up, the icon will be enabled:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/canjs-button-enabled.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools extension icon - enabled"
  width="600px"/>

The CanJS Devtools extension adds several new pieces of functionality to Chrome's Developer Tools. These are discussed in the sections below.

## Using the CanJS Devtools Panel

CanJS Devtools adds a top-level "CanJS" panel to Chrome's Developer Tools. This panel is made up of a Component Tree on the left and several sections on the right for handling common tasks.

### Component Tree

The Component Tree is similar to the built-in Elements Panel, but only shows CanJS Components.

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel"
  width="600px"/>

Clicking on a component in the tree will select it:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-component-selected.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel ViewModel Editor"
  width="600px"/>

If a component is selected in the Elements Panel, it will automatically be selected in the CanJS Panel. If an element that is not a component is selected, its closest parent component will be selected automatically, if there is one.

### ViewModel Editor

As mentioned above, once a component is selected, its ViewModel will be displayed in the ViewModel Editor in the sidebar.

Maps and Lists can be expanded in the Editor by clicking on a key that has a dropdown, or by clicking the dropdown directly.

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/viewmodel-editor.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel ViewModel Editor Expanding Object"
  width="600px"/>

A property's value can be edited by clicking on it:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/viewmodel-editor-edit-strings.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel ViewModel Editor Edit Property Value"
  width="600px"/>

Boolean values can also be edited using the quick toggle checkbox:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/viewmodel-editor-edit-booleans.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel ViewModel Editor Edit Boolean Property Value"
  width="600px"/>

When hovering over a property, options will be shown on the right. All properties can be removed by clicking the &minus; icon. If the property is an object, new properties can be added by clicking the &plus; icon:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/viewmodel-editor-add-remove-options.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel ViewModel Editor Property Value Options"
  width="600px"/>

New properties can also be added to objects by clicking anywhere inside the object:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/viewmodel-editor-new-key-value.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel ViewModel Editor New Key Value Editor"
  width="600px"/>

Once changes have been made, they can be applied back to the source ViewModel, by clicking the "Apply Changes" button.

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/viewmodel-editor-apply-changes.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel ViewModel Editor Apply Changes"
  width="600px"/>

### ViewModel Mutations Breakpoints

The CanJS Devtools Panel also allows you to create breakpoints for when mutations happen to Component ViewModels.

The ViewModel Mutation Breakpoints sidebar can be expanded by clicking on the header:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-breakpoints-expanded.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel Breakpoints Editor"
  width="600px"/>

Once expanded, a breakpoint can be created by typing an expression into the `<input>` element.

These expressions can be property names like `canPlaceOrder`, `order.total`, or `order.items.length`:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-creating-breakpoint.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel Breakpoints Editor Change Breakpoint Creation"
  width="600px"/>

Expressions like this will create breakpoints that will be hit whenever the value of that property changes. When these breakpoints are hit, the [can-queues.logStack] output will be displayed in the console so you can see exactly what caused the mutation to occur:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-stopped-at-change-breakpoint.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel Breakpoints Editor Change Breakpoint Debugger"
  width="600px"/>

Breakpoints like `order.items.length > 2` can also be created using [comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Comparison_operators):

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-with-breakpoints.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel Breakpoints Editor Boolean Breakpoint Creation"
  width="600px"/>

Expressions like this will create breakpoints that will be hit whenever the value of the expression changes from [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) to [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy):

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-stopped-at-boolean-breakpoint.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel Breakpoints Editor Boolean Breakpoint Debugger"
  width="600px"/>

Once created, breakpoints can be disabled by clicking on the checkbox:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-with-breakpoints-disabled.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel Breakpoints Editor Breakpoint Disable"
  width="600px"/>

Breakpoints can also be deleted by clicking on the &minus; icon:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/panel-with-breakpoints-deleted.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Panel Breakpoints Editor Breakpoint Delete"
  width="600px"/>


## Using the CanJS Devtools Queues Stack

As discussed in [Debug what caused a observable event or update to happen](#Debugwhatcausedaobservableeventorupdatetohappen_), the [can-queues.logStack] method of [can-queues] can help figure out what tasks in CanJS’s queue system caused a function to run. In order to make this easier, CanJS Devtools adds a sidebar to the Sources Panel to display the `logStack` output:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/queues-stack.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Queues Stack"
  width="600px"/>

When stopped at a breakpoint in the Chrome Developer Tools, the Queues Stack is available in the sidebar:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/queues-stack-zoomed.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Queues Stack"
  width="600px"/>

Clicking on a function will open its definition in the Sources panel:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/queues-stack-click-through.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Queues Stack"
  width="600px"/>

## Using the CanJS Devtools Bindings Graph

When an element is selected in the Elements panel, a tab for the CanJS Bindings Graph will be added to the sidebar:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/bindings-graph-viewmodel.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Bindings Graph"
  width="600px"/>

In order to find this, select the Elements panel:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/devtools-elements-panel.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The Chrome Developer Tools Elements Panel"
  width="600px"/>

Then, depending on the size of the Developer Tools window, the CanJS Bindings Graph may be in the overflow menu:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/devtools-sidebar-overflow-menu.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The Chrome Developer Tools Sidebar Overflow Menu"
  width="600px"/>

If the element that is selected has a ViewModel, the graph will show the relationships for a property of the ViewModel:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/bindings-graph-viewmodel.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Bindings Graph"
  width="600px"/>

By default, the property selected will be the _first_ property on the ViewModel alphabetically. Another property can be selected by clicking on the header:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/bindings-graph-viewmodel-click.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Bindings Graph Property Selection"
  width="600px"/>

A dropdown of all of the available properties will be displayed:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/bindings-graph-viewmodel-select-property.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Bindings Graph Property Selection Dropdown"
  width="600px"/>

If the element selected does not have a ViewModel, the graph will show the relationships for the element itself:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/bindings-graph-element.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The CanJS Devtools Bindings Graph for Element"
  width="600px"/>

## Using the standalone CanJS Devtools ViewModel Editor

Similar to the Bindings Graph, a sidebar is added for the CanJS ViewModel Editor. The ViewModel Editor will be shown for the selected element &mdash; or the closest parent element that has a ViewModel:

<img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/devtools/standalone-viewmodel-editor.png"
  class="bit-docs-screenshot"
  alt="The Chrome Developer Tools Standalone ViewModel Editor"
  width="600px"/>

The standalone ViewModel Editor has the same features as the Editor in the [CanJS Panel](#ViewModelEditor).
