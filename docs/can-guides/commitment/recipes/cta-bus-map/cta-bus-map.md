@description This guide walks you through showing Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus locations on a Google Map.  


@body

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Use `fetch` to request data.
- Create a custom element that wraps a google map.
- Add markers to the google map.

The final widget looks like:

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/janupaq/8/embed?output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

To use the widget:

1. __Click__ a _Bus Route_.
2. __Explore__ the markers added to the Google Map showing the bus locations for that route.
3. __Click__ the _route name overlay_ to refresh the bus locations.

The following sections are broken down the following parts:

- __The problem__ — A description of what the section is trying to accomplish.
- __What you need to know__ — Information about CanJS that is useful for solving the problem.
- __How to verify it works__ - How to make sure the solution works if it's not obvious.
- __The solution__ — The solution to the problem.

## Setup ##

__START THIS TUTORIAL BY CLONING THE FOLLOWING JS BIN__:

> Click the `JS Bin` button.  The JSBin will open in a new window. In that new window, under `File`, click `Clone`.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/milodet/3/embed?html,js,output">CanJS Bus Demo on jsbin.com</a>

This JS Bin has initial prototype HTML and CSS which is useful for
getting the application to look right.




### What you need to know

There's nothing to do in this step. The JSBin is already setup with:

- A _basic_ CanJS setup.
- A promise that resolves when the Google Maps has loaded.
- Some variables useful to make requests to get bus routes and locations.

Please read on to understand the setup.

__A Basic CanJS Setup__

- A basic CanJS setup uses instances of a ViewModel to manage the
  behavior of a View.  A ViewModel type is defined, an instance of it
  is created and passed to a View as follows:

  ```js
// Define the ViewModel type
const MyViewModel = can.DefineMap.extend( "MyViewModel", {

// ...
} );

// Create an instance of the ViewModel
const viewModel = new MyViewModel();

// Get a View
const view = can.stache.from( "my-view" );

// Render the View with the ViewModel instance
const frag = view( viewModel );
document.body.appendChild( frag );
```

- CanJS uses [can-stache] to render data in a template
  and keep it live.  Templates can be authored in `<script>` tags like:

  ```html
  <script type="text/stache" id="app-view">
    TEMPLATE CONTENT
  </script>
  ```

  A [can-stache] template uses
  [can-stache.tags.escaped {{key}}] "magic tags" to insert data into
  the HTML output like:

  ```html
  <script type="text/stache" id="app-view">
    {{something.name}}
  </script>
  ```

- Load a template from a `<script>` tag with [can-stache.from can.stache.from] like:
  ```js
const template = can.stache.from( SCRIPT_ID );
```

- Render the template with data into a documentFragment like:

  ```js
const frag = template( {
	something: { name: "Derek Brunson" }
} );
```

- Insert a fragment into the page with:

  ```js
document.body.appendChild( frag );
```

__Loading Google Maps API__

The following loads [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/):

```
<script>
  window.googleAPI = new Promise(function(resolve){
    const script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyD7POAQA-i16Vws48h4yRFVGBZzIExOAJI";
    document.body.appendChild( script );
    script.onload = resolve;
  });
</script>
```

It creates a global `googleAPI` promise that resolves when Google Maps is ready.  You can use it like:

```js
googleAPI.then( function() {
	new google.maps.Map( /* ... */ );
} );
```

__Loading CTA Bus Data__

This app needs to make requests to the [http://www.ctabustracker.com/](http://www.ctabustracker.com/) API.  The
`ctabustracker` API is hosted at:

```js
const apiRoot = "http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/api/v2/";
```

The API needs a token as part of the request:

```js
const token = "?key=piRYHjJ5D2Am39C9MxduHgRZc&format=json";
```

However, the API does __not__ support cross origin requests.  Therefore, we will request data using
a proxy hosted at:

```js
const proxyUrl = "https://can-cors.herokuapp.com/";
```

With that proxy, the requests for this app will look like:

```js
fetch( "https://can-cors.herokuapp.com/" +
"http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/api/v2/" +
"getroutes" +
"?key=piRYHjJ5D2Am39C9MxduHgRZc&format=json" );
```

## Change the app title ##

### The problem

In this section, we will:

- Explore the relationship between ViewModel and View.
- Make it so the title of the page changes from `<h1>YOUR TITLE HERE</h1>`
  to `<h1>CHICAGO CTA BUS TRACKER</h1>`.
- Let us adjust the title simply by changing the viewModel like:
  ```js
viewModel.title = "TITLE UPDATED";
```

![YOUR TITLE HERE](../../../docs/can-guides/commitment/recipes/cta-bus-map/1-app-title.png)


### What you need to know


- A [can-stache] template uses
  [can-stache.tags.escaped {{key}}] magic tags to insert data into
  the HTML output like:

  ```html
  {{someValue}}
  ```

  These values come from a ViewModel or Model.

- The [can-define.types.default] property definition can return the initial value of a property like:
  ```js
const AppViewModel = can.DefineMap.extend( {
	someValue: {
		default: "This string"
	}
} );
new AppViewModel().someValue; //-> "This string"
```

### How to verify it works

Run the following in the `Console` tab:

```js
viewModel.title = "TITLE UPDATED";
```

You should see the title update.

### The solution

Update the `view` in the __HTML__ tab to:

@sourceref ./1-setup.html
@highlight 3,only

Update the __JavaScript__ tab to:

@sourceref ./1-setup.js
@highlight 8-10,only


## List bus routes ##

### The problem

In this section, we will:

- Load and list bus routes.
- Show `<p>Loading routes…</p>` while loading routes.

![List Bus Routes](../../../docs/can-guides/commitment/recipes/cta-bus-map/2-list-routes.png)


We will do this by:

- Store the promise of bus routes in a `routesPromise` property.
- `routesPromise` will resolve to an `Array` of the routes.
- Loop through each route and add an `<li>` to the page.
- Show the loading message while `routesPromise` is pending.


### What you need to know

- The [can-define.types.default] property definition can return the initial value of a property like:
  ```js
const AppViewModel = can.DefineMap.extend( {
	myProperty: {
		default: function() {
			return new Promise( /* ... */ );
		}
	}
} );
new AppViewModel().myProperty; //-> Promise
```
- The [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is an easy way to make requests
  to a URL and get back JSON.  Use it like:

  ```js
fetch( url ).then( function( response ) {
	return response.json();
} ).then( function( data ) {
} );
```

  You'll want to use the `proxyUrl` and `getRoutesEnpoint` variables to make a request for
  CTA bus routes. The routes service returns data like:

  ```js
{
	"bustime-response": {
		"routes": [
			{
				"rt": "1",
				"rtnm": "Bronzeville/Union Station",
				"rtclr": "#336633",
				"rtdd": "1"
			}

			// ...
		]
	}
}
```

  Make sure that `routesPromise` will be a Promise that resolves to an array of routes.

- Promises can transform data by returning new values.  For example if `outerPromise`
  resolves to `{innerData: {name: "inner"}}`, `resultPromise` will resolve to
  `{name: "inner"}`:
  ```js
const resultPromise = outerPromise.then( function( data ) {
	return data.innerData;
} );
```

- Use [can-stache.helpers.if {{#if(value)}}] to do `if/else` branching in `can-stache`.
- Use [can-stache.helpers.each {{#each(value)}}] to do looping in `can-stache`.
- `Promise`s are observable in [can-stache].  Given a promise `somePromise`, you can:
  - Check if the promise is loading like: `{{#if(somePromise.isPending)}}`.
  - Loop through the resolved value of the promise like: `{{#each(somePromise.value)}}`.

### The solution

Update the `view` in the __HTML__ tab to:

@sourceref ./2-list-routes.html
@highlight 4,7-13,only

Update the __JavaScript__ tab to:

@sourceref ./2-list-routes.js
@highlight 11-17,only


## Pick a route and log bus locations ##

### The problem

In this section, we will:

- Highlight the selected bus route after a user clicks it.
- Log the bus (vehicle) locations for the selected route.

<img src="../../../docs/can-guides/commitment/recipes/cta-bus-map/3-pick-route.png" width="857px"/>

We will do this by:

- Listening to when a user clicks one of the bus routes.
- Adding `active` to the class name of that route's `<li>` like: `<li class="active">`.
- Making the request for the vehicle locations of the selected route.

### What you need to know

- Use [can-stache-bindings.event] to listen to an event on an element and call a method in `can-stache`.  For example, the following calls `doSomething()` when the `<div>` is clicked:

  ```html
  <div on:click="doSomething()"> ... </div>
  ```
- Use the `"any"` type to define a property of indeterminate type:
  ```js
const AppViewModel = can.DefineMap.extend( {
	myProperty: "any"
} );
const viewModel = new AppViewModel( {} );
viewModel.myProperty = ANYTHING;
```
  You'll want to store the selected bus route as `route`.
- Use `fetch(proxyUrl + getVehiclesEndpoint + "&rt=" + route.rt)`
  to get the vehicles for a particular route. If there is route data, it comes
  back like:
  ```js
{
	"bustime-response": {
		"vehicle": [
			{
				"vid": "8026",
				"tmstmp": "20171004 09:18",
				"lat": "41.73921241760254",
				"lon": "-87.66306991577149",
				"hdg": "359",
				"pid": 3637,
				"rt": "9",
				"des": "74th",
				"pdist": 6997,
				"dly": false,
				"tatripid": "10002232",
				"tablockid": "X9  -607",
				"zone": ""
			}

			// ...
		]
	}
}
```

  If there is an error or no buses, the response looks like:

  ```js
{
	"bustime-response": {
		"error": [
			{
				"rt": "5",
				"msg": "No data found for parameter"
			}
		]
	}
}
```


### How to verify it works

In the `Console` tab, when you click a bus route (like `Cottage Grove`), you should see
an array of bus routes.

### The solution
Update the `view` in the __HTML__ tab to:

@sourceref ./3-pick-route.html
@highlight 8,17-22,only

Update the __JavaScript__ tab to:

@sourceref ./3-pick-route.js
@highlight 18-30,only


## Show when buses are loading and the number of buses ##
### The problem

In this section, we will:

- Show `<p>Loading vehicles…</p>` while bus data is being loaded.
- Show `<div class="error-message">No vehicles available for this route</div>` in the overlay
  if the request for bus data failed.  
- Show the number of buses inside the `<div class='gmap'>` like: `Bus count: 20`.

<img src="../../../docs/can-guides/commitment/recipes/cta-bus-map/3b-bus-loading.png" width="427px"/>


We will do this by:

- Defining and setting a `vehiclesPromise` property.

### What you need to know

- In stache, you can check if a promise was rejected like:
  ```html
  {{#if(somePromise.isRejected)}}<p>...</p>{{/if}}
  ```
- The [Promise.reject](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject) method returns a rejected promise with the provided `reason`:
  ```js
const rejectedPromise = Promise.reject( { message: "something went wrong" } );
```
- Promises can transform data by returning new promises.  For example if `outerPromise`
  resolves to `{innerData: {name: "inner"}}`, `resultPromise` will be a rejected promise
  with the `reason` as `{name: "inner"}`:
  ```js
const resultPromise = outerPromise.then( function( data ) {
	return Promise.reject( data.innerData );
} );
resultPromise.catch( function( reason ) {
	reason.name; //-> "inner"
} );
```

### The solution
Update the `view` in the __HTML__ tab to:

@sourceref ./3b-bus-loading.html
@highlight 5,21-23,26,only

Update the __JavaScript__ tab to:

@sourceref ./3b-bus-loading.js
@highlight 19,22,26,28,only


## Initialize Google Maps to show Chicago ##

### The problem

In this section, we will:

- Create a custom `<google-map-view/>` element that adds a google
  map.
- The google map should be added to a `<div class='gmap'/>` element.
- The google map should be centered on Chicago (latitude: `41.881`, longitude `-87.623`).

<img src="../../../docs/can-guides/commitment/recipes/cta-bus-map/4-init-gmaps.png" width="428px"/>

We will do this by:

- Creating a custom [can-component] element that adds the `<div class='gmap'/>` to its HTML.
- Listens to when the element is in the page and creates a new google map.

### What you need to know

- Use [can-component] to create custom elements.  Start by [can-component.extend extending]
  `Component` with the `tag` of the element:

  ```js
can.Component.extend( {
	tag: "google-map-view"
} );
```

  Next, provide the HTML [can-stache] template with the content you want to insert within
  the element.

  ```js
can.Component.extend( {
	tag: "google-map-view",
	view: can.stache( "<div class='gmap'/>" )
} );
```

  Any values you want the custom element to hold must be defined on the `ViewModel`. If the `ViewModel`
  is a plain `Object`, that object will be used to extend [can-define/map/map DefineMap] and create a new
  type.  The following specifies a `map` property that can be any value:

  ```js
can.Component.extend( {
	tag: "google-map-view",
	view: can.stache( "<div class='gmap'/>" ),
	ViewModel: {
		map: "any"
	}
} );
```

  A ViewModel's [can-component/connectedCallback] can be used to know when the component's element is inserted into the document as follows:

  ```js
can.Component.extend( {
	tag: "google-map-view",
	view: can.stache( "<div class='gmap'/>" ),
	ViewModel: {
		map: "any",
		connectedCallback( element ) {
			this; // -> the ViewModel instance
			element; // -> the <google-map-view> element
		}
	}
} );
```

- To create a google map, use [new google.map.Map(...)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference) once the
  `googleAPI` has completed loading:

  ```js
new google.maps.Map( gmapDiv, {
	zoom: 10,
	center: {
		lat: 41.881,
		lng: -87.623
	}
} );
```


### The solution
Update the `view` in the __HTML__ tab to:

@sourceref ./4-init-gmaps.html
@highlight 26,only

Update the __JavaScript__ tab to:

@sourceref ./4-init-gmaps.js
@highlight 34-51,only

## Set markers for vehicle locations ##

### The problem

In this section, we will:

- Show markers at bus locations when the user clicks a route.

We will do this by:

- Passing the `vehicles` from `vehiclePromise` to `<google-map-view>`.
- Listening when `vehicles` changes and creating google map `Marker`s.


### What you need to know

- [can-stache-bindings.toChild childProp:from] can set a component's ViewModel from another value:
  ```html
  <google-map-view viewModelProp:from="scopeValue"/>
  ```
- A component's [can-component.prototype.events] object can be used to listen to events on the
  `ViewModel` instance with:
  `"{viewModel} propertyName"` like:

  ```js
can.Component.extend( {

// ...
	events: {
		"{viewModel} vehicles": function( viewModel, event, newVehicles ) {

			// do stuff with the newVehicles
		}
	}
} );
```

- Use [new google.maps.Marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker) to
  add a marker to a map like:

  ```js
new google.maps.Marker( {
	position: {
		lat: parseFloat( vehicle.lat ),
		lng: parseFloat( vehicle.lon )
	},
	map: this.viewModel.map
} );
```

### The solution
Update the `view` in the __HTML__ tab to:

@sourceref ./5-set-markers.html
@highlight 26,only

Update the __JavaScript__ tab to:

@sourceref ./5-set-markers.js
@highlight 50,53-65,only

## Clean up markers when locations change ##

### The problem

In this section we will:

- Remove markers from previous routes.
- Update marker locations when the user clicks the overlay.

We will do this by:

- Storing the active list of markers on the `ViewModel`
- Clearing the old active markers when the list of vehicles is updated.
- Calling `pickRoute` when someone clicks on the `route-selected` overlay.

### What you need to know


- Use `marker.setMap(null)` to remove a marker from a map.


### The solution
Update the `view` in the __HTML__ tab to:

@sourceref ./6-clean-markers.html
@highlight 19,only

Update the __JavaScript__ tab to:

@sourceref ./6-clean-markers.js
@highlight 51,55-60,62,only
