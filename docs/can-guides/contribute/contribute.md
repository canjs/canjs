## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CanJS! CanJS is maintained by
[the DoneJS core team](https://donejs.com/About.html#core-team) but depends on
contributors like you! Whether you’re interested in [guides/contributing/finding-ways-to-contribute#Findingopenissues fixing issues],
[guides/contributing/finding-ways-to-contribute#Gettinginvolvedinthecommunity answering questions],
or [guides/contributing/evangelism spreading the word], we welcome you to our community!

Contributing to an open source project can be an intimidating experience. All
contributions from all types of contributors are welcome. We’re committed to
making it as pleasant and rewarding as possible. We’re happy to set up a pairing
session to show you how to fix a bug or write a feature.

If you have any questions, you can always reach us on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs).

there are other users who generously help others.

If you’re interested in contributing to CanJS, the core team is happy to pair
with you to fix a bug or write a new feature! Please either message us on Gitter
or the forums, or leave a comment on the GitHub issue you’re interested in

environment, creating a test and/or writing documentation, and submitting a pull
request.
