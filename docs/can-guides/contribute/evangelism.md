## Overview

Hopefully you love CanJS as much as we do and you want to share your
knowledge about it.  Fantastic!  We can help you.

There’s lots of ways to spread the word about CanJS such as:

 - Giving a presentation at a conference or meetup
 - Organizing or speaking at a CanJS or DoneJS meetup
 - Writing a blog article

Whatever you do, please let us know so we can promote you and what you’re doing.

## Speaking at a conference or meetup

The [Presentations Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0Bx-kNqf-wxZeaWc2ay1ZSzZZQXc)
contains all of the DoneJS teams talks organized by project.  It contains
a CanJS folder with CanJS presentations.  

Some of the presentations are out dated, but it’s a good place to check for
existing content.

## Organizing a CanJS meetup

There are several CanJS meetup groups already created:

- [Boston](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-Boston/)
- [Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-Chicago/)
- [Ft. Lauderdale](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-Fort-Lauderdale/)
- [Los Angeles](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-LA/)
- [New York](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-NYC/)
- [Phoenix](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-Phoenix/)
- [Raleigh-Durham](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-raleigh-durham/)
- [San Francisco](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-San-Francisco/)
- [Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-Seattle/)
- [Silicon Valley](https://www.meetup.com/DoneJS-Silicon-Valley/)

We’re always looking for people to speak at one of these meetups, become an organizer,
or start their own meetup.  If you are interested in any of these things,
please let Justin Meyer know (`justin@bitovi.com`).

## Writing a blog article

If you’re writing something about CanJS and would like us to review it,
we’re happy to help.  Once it’s published, let us know so we can promote it.
